Summary:
This script prompts the technician for several key pieces of information, before performing the following:
- Creates a log file and dumps each command to it. The log file will be in the root of the directory where you're running the script
- Assigns a Hostname and Password to the Fortigate
- Sets a static IP and Subnet to WAN1. Only ping and https will be an options
- Sets a static route so all IP addresses go through the ISP gateway
- Enables SNMP on the Local Network Interface
- Enables SNMP Agent
- Configures SNMP Community String on the Router and any Switches that would get connected to it. Points back to the auvik collector.
- Creates BBQ&Guns Address and "Friendly Countries" Address Group
- Enables SYSLOG and points it to the auvikcollector
- Prompt tech if they're installing a phone system, if they check the box and fill out the information, then the script will create the allworx VIP's, Group, and Policy. Note: It defaults to using 'lan' in the policy.


Modifications:
- The script was calling "lan" in several spots instead of the variable localnetworkinterface
- It now queries for the internal lan by its ip 192.168.1.99
- In doing so, the top half of the log file got cut off since it breaks the data stream. I added the variable input_values and added it to the top of the log file that gets created
